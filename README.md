# odin-recipes
This is Project: Recipes from The Odin Project Foundations course. I used html to create a website with a homepage and relative links to three similarly structured recipe pages.

This project demonstrates the use of basic html features including:
- file structure
- document structure
- headings and paragraphs
- ordered and unordered lists
- absolute and relative links
- comments
- images
